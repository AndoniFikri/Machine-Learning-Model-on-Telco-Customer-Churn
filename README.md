# Machine-Learning-Model-on-Telco-Customer-Churn
One of the key important things in learning a new stuff is by starting off a simple project. 

This time, I'm gonna try to model a supervised classification machine learning model from a mainstream dataset, Telco Customer Churn. 
The mainstream data set could be found through this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn. 

View things that I've done for this projects are: 
1. Data Preprocessing which include data cleansing and label encoding for categorical data. 
2. Simple EDA to know what type of data set that we are modelling (Balanced or Imbalanced).
3. Comparison of Logistic Regression and Random Forrest model in predicting customer churn with Metric Evaluation.
